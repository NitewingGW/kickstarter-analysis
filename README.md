#Kickstarter Analysis

The purpose of the the kickstarter analysis was to discover any patterns or trends related to the success, cancellations or failures of a campaign.

#Challenges

Hard drive failed on primary computer and excel is no longer functioning properly. I was unable to copy and paste formulas over large portions of columns. There were no complications with the data itself. Just limitation of excel that may or may not be related to hardware issues.

#Analysis campaigns and the funding goals
Outcome of campaign appears to be directly tied to the goal amount. If the goal is between $1 and $5000 your campaign is highly likely to succeed ragardless of topic or focus. This may be due the risk level presented to the investor. As the goal amount increases so does the risk to the investor and the campaign owner. After the goal is increased to $10,000 success is consistently less than 50%. This present a risk to both investor and campaign runner. At this point the focus of the campaign, the target audience and its presentation will play a much larger part in the campaigns success. Campaign runner may need to consider targeted advertising and focusing on topics that are popular or trending. Marketing and a marketing plan become much more valuable. Of note for both investor and campang runneris the fact that campaigns that have a funding goal above $45,000 rarely successful. Campaigns are more likely to fail or be cancelled than they are to succeeding. Also on a personal note, I realize if I were to do a capmaing personally I'd likely want to start at less than $5000 and use the success of the previous funding round to build confidence in my product/campaign.

#Analysis of Time of year and Theatre campaings success
This data is fairly misleading as is the graph itself. There does not appear to be a direct coorealtion of the time of year that a theatre campaign is started. There are a few times of year where cancellation and failure appear to be more likely those being  October and December. The Data overall tends to lean towards an approximate 2:1 ration success to failure. The summers months are the time a lot more theatre projects are started but that start only appears to have a slight positive effect on the odds of success (May and June being the hotspots).

#Shortfall
Data does not provide any detail into the investment on the part of the campaign runner for advertising, nor does it provide information of the investors demographics or the campaigns target audience. Having that information would go a long way towards designing a campaign above $5000 that would have a higher chance of success. That information could also help a campaign runner feel more confident before starting a campaign that has a funding goal above $45,000. I personally would not start a campaign above $45,000 without significantly more data.
